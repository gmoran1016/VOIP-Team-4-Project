# VOIP-Team-4-Project

CURRENT STATUS:

app.py- Program is currently functioning as intended. All that's left are a few tweaks and setting up a host server for deployment.

TODO:
1. Fix format code so number can be entered in any format
2. Upload to cloud service for deployment - current plan is to use AWS
3. Make sure it can handle multiple users at once - should be possible once hosted on AWS
4. Figure out hosting solution for mp3 file generated by TTS - should be doable via AWS as well
