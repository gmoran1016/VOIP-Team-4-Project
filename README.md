# VOIP-Team-4-Project

CURRENT STATUS:

app.py- Program currently works in a basic sense. Can take inputs and complete a call. Hosted on a server and can be used currently.

TODO:
1. Fix format code so number can be entered in any format
2. Make sure it can handle multiple user at once. ( Probably can't do this at the moment)
